# Browser Automation with playwright-cli

## Setup Gate (run on first use)

Before using any commands below, verify the environment. Do NOT skip this gate.

**Step 1 — Check if playwright-cli is available:**

```bash
playwright-cli --version
```

- If it prints a version number (e.g. `0.1.13`) → skip to **Quick start**.
- If it fails (`not recognized` / `command not found`) → continue to Step 2.

**Step 2 — Check if Node.js is available:**

```bash
node --version
```

- If it fails → **STOP**. Tell the user: *"Node.js v18+ is required. Install from https://nodejs.org/ then re-run this skill."*
- If the version is below v18 → **STOP**. Tell the user: *"Node.js v18+ is required. Current version is too old — please upgrade."*
- If v18+ → continue to Step 3.

**Step 3 — Auto-install playwright-cli:**

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
```

Success: exit code 0, npm prints `added N packages`. Warnings in stderr are normal and can be ignored if exit code is 0.

On permission errors (`EACCES` on macOS/Linux, `EPERM` on Windows): retry with `sudo npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest` (Unix) or run the terminal as Administrator (Windows).

**Step 4 — Verify the install:**

```bash
playwright-cli --version
```

- If it prints a version (e.g. `0.1.13`) → proceed to Step 5.
- If it still fails (e.g., global installs are restricted), use the **npx fallback**: prefix every `playwright-cli` command in this skill with `npx @playwright/cli` instead. Example: `npx @playwright/cli open` instead of `playwright-cli open`. This applies to **all** commands in Quick start and the sections below.

**Step 5 — Ask the user: browser mode preference**

By default, `playwright-cli open` runs in **headless** mode (no visible browser window). Ask the user which mode they prefer via the question channel:

```
### Question: How should the browser run?

Tip: If unsure, pick **A** — it's the most common choice for UI development. Choose B for background automation.

- **A)** Headed (recommended) — opens a visible browser window on your screen. You can watch the agent navigate, click, and type in real time. Best for developing, debugging, learning, and demos.
- **B)** Headless — the browser runs invisibly in the background. No window appears on your screen. Faster, uses less resources, and won't interrupt your work. Best for automated tasks, CI/CD, or batch operations.
- **C)** Headed + Monitoring dashboard — a visible browser window plus a live dashboard (`playwright-cli show`) where you can see all running sessions at a glance with live screencasts, current URLs, and the ability to click into any session to take over mouse/keyboard control. Best when running multiple sessions.
- **D)** Headless + Monitoring dashboard — the browser runs invisibly, but the monitoring dashboard lets you peek at all running sessions anytime. Best of both worlds: no window clutter, but full observability.
- **E)** Headed + Annotation mode — a visible browser window plus an interactive annotation tool (`playwright-cli show --annotate`) where you can draw boxes on the page and type review comments. The agent receives your annotated screenshot, the snapshot of the marked region, and your notes. Best for UI review and design feedback.
- **F)** Headless + Annotation mode — the browser runs invisibly, but opens the annotation tool for UI review. Best for remote review workflows where you don't need to see the browser directly.
```

Apply based on the user's choice:
- **A (Headed)**: append `--headed` to every `playwright-cli open` command. Example: `playwright-cli open https://example.com --headed`
- **B (Headless)**: use commands as written — no extra flags needed.
- **C (Headed + Monitoring)**: append `--headed` to `open`, then run `playwright-cli show` after the browser is open.
- **D (Headless + Monitoring)**: use commands as written, then run `playwright-cli show` after the browser is open.
- **E (Headed + Annotation)**: append `--headed` to `open`, then run `playwright-cli show --annotate` when UI feedback is needed.
- **F (Headless + Annotation)**: use commands as written, then run `playwright-cli show --annotate` when UI feedback is needed.

playwright-cli unroute
```

### DevTools

```bash
playwright-cli console
playwright-cli console warning
playwright-cli requests
playwright-cli request 5
playwright-cli run-code "async page => await page.context().grantPermissions(['geolocation'])"
playwright-cli run-code --filename=script.js
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli tracing-stop
playwright-cli video-start video.webm

playwright-cli video-stop

# open the monitoring dashboard to observe all running browser sessions (live screencasts, remote control)
playwright-cli show
# launch the dashboard for UI review / design feedback — user annotates the page, you receive the annotated screenshot, snapshot, and notes
playwright-cli show --annotate

# generate a Playwright locator for an element from its ref or selector
playwright-cli generate-locator e5 --raw

# show a persistent highlight overlay for an element, optionally with a custom style
playwright-cli highlight e5
playwright-cli highlight e5 --style="outline: 3px dashed red"
# hide a single element highlight, or all page highlights when no target is given
playwright-cli highlight e5 --hide
playwright-cli highlight --hide
```

## Raw output

The global `--raw` option strips page status, generated code, and snapshot sections from the output, returning only the result value. Use it to pipe command output into other tools. Commands that don't produce output return nothing.

```bash
playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify(performance.timing)" | jq '.loadEventEnd - .navigationStart'
playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify([...document.querySelectorAll('a')].map(a => a.href))" > links.json
playwright-cli --raw snapshot > before.yml
playwright-cli click e5
playwright-cli --raw snapshot > after.yml
diff before.yml after.yml
TOKEN=$(playwright-cli --raw cookie-get session_id)
playwright-cli --raw localstorage-get theme
```

For structured output wrapping every reply as JSON, pass --json
```bash
playwright-cli list --json
```

## Open parameters
```bash
# Use specific browser when creating session
playwright-cli open --browser=chrome
playwright-cli open --browser=firefox
playwright-cli open --browser=webkit
playwright-cli open --browser=msedge

# Use persistent profile (by default profile is in-memory)
playwright-cli open --persistent
# Use persistent profile with custom directory
playwright-cli open --profile=/path/to/profile

# Connect to browser via Playwright Extension
playwright-cli attach --extension=chrome

# Connect to a running Chrome or Edge by channel name
playwright-cli attach --cdp=chrome
playwright-cli attach --cdp=msedge

# Connect to a running browser via CDP endpoint
playwright-cli attach --cdp=http://localhost:9222

# Start with config file
playwright-cli open --config=my-config.json

# Close the browser
playwright-cli close
# Detach from an attached browser (leaves the external browser running)
playwright-cli -s=msedge detach
# Delete user data for the default session
playwright-cli delete-data
```

## Snapshots

After each command, playwright-cli provides a snapshot of the current browser state.

```bash
> playwright-cli goto https://example.com
### Page
- Page URL: https://example.com/
- Page Title: Example Domain
### Snapshot
[Snapshot](.playwright-cli/page-2026-02-14T19-22-42-679Z.yml)
```

You can also take a snapshot on demand using `playwright-cli snapshot` command. All the options below can be combined as needed.

```bash
# default - save to a file with timestamp-based name
playwright-cli snapshot

# save to file, use when snapshot is a part of the workflow result
playwright-cli snapshot --filename=after-click.yaml

# snapshot an element instead of the whole page
playwright-cli snapshot "#main"

# limit snapshot depth for efficiency, take a partial snapshot afterwards
playwright-cli snapshot --depth=4
playwright-cli snapshot e34

# include each element's bounding box as [box=x,y,width,height]
playwright-cli snapshot --boxes
```

## Targeting elements

By default, use refs from the snapshot to interact with page elements.

```bash
# get snapshot with refs
playwright-cli snapshot

# interact using a ref
playwright-cli click e15
```

You can also use css selectors or Playwright locators.

```bash
# css selector
playwright-cli click "#main > button.submit"

# role locator
playwright-cli click "getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })"

# test id
playwright-cli click "getByTestId('submit-button')"
```

## Browser Sessions

```bash
# create new browser session named "mysession" with persistent profile
playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --persistent
# same with manually specified profile directory (use when requested explicitly)
playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --profile=/path/to/profile
playwright-cli -s=mysession click e6
playwright-cli -s=mysession close  # stop a named browser
playwright-cli -s=mysession delete-data  # delete user data for persistent session

playwright-cli list
# Close all browsers
playwright-cli close-all
# Forcefully kill all browser processes
playwright-cli kill-all
```

## Installation

If global `playwright-cli` command is not available, try a local version via npx:

```bash
npx @playwright/cli --version
```

When this works, prefix all commands in this skill with `npx @playwright/cli` (e.g. `npx @playwright/cli open`). Otherwise, install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
```

## Example: Form submission

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com/form
playwright-cli snapshot

playwright-cli fill e1 "user@example.com"
playwright-cli fill e2 "password123"
playwright-cli click e3
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Multi-tab workflow

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tab-new https://example.com/other
playwright-cli tab-list
playwright-cli tab-select 0
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Debugging with DevTools

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli console
playwright-cli requests
playwright-cli close
```

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli tracing-stop
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Interactive session

Ask the user for UI review or design feedback. The user draws boxes on the live page and types comments; you receive the annotated screenshot, the snapshot of the marked region, and the user's notes. Use this whenever the user asks for "UI review", "design feedback", or to "ask the user what they think / want / mean":

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli show --annotate
```
